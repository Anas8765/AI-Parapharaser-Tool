# AI-Parapharaser-Tool

This AI tool utilizes the Pegasus model to paraphrase any length of text or paragraph into entirely new content. It can also generate a specified number 'n' of different sentences from a text by adjusting the value of 'n' in the code segment 'get_response(text, n)'. The model has been quantized using bits and bytes quantization, enabling it to run efficiently even on low-end computing devices while delivering maximum performance.

**Explanation:**

- **Functionality**: The AI tool employs the Pegasus model for paraphrasing text, creating entirely new content from any length of input.
  
- **Sentence Generation**: It can also generate a customizable number of sentences ('n') by modifying the 'n' parameter in the function call 'get_response(text, n)'.
  
- **Quantization**: The model has undergone quantization using bits and bytes, optimizing it to operate effectively on less powerful computing hardware without compromising performance.
